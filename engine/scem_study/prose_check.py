"""SCEM — every percentage and multiple in the delivered documents, reconciled.

The mechanism is engine/prose_figures.py, shared with every other study; what is declared
here is only what is genuinely this study's own: which documents a reader receives, and
which figures may legitimately be quoted against something other than a model output.

A FALSE POSITIVE IS FIXED BY WIDENING THE RENDERING SET, NEVER BY DELETING THE FIGURE FROM
THE STUDY. If a figure is real and the model cannot produce it, the model is what is
missing.
